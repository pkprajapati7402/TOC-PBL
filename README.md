This web application converts regular expressions to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) using the parse tree method. It's a useful tool for students, educators, and professionals working with formal languages and automata theory.

## Disclaimer

This application is primarily designed for educational purposes. It is intended to serve as a learning tool for students, educators, and those interested in understanding the process of converting regular expressions to DFAs.

Please note:
- This tool is not optimized for large-scale or production use.
- It may not be suitable for complex, real-world applications that require high-performance processing.
- The primary focus is on demonstrating the conversion process clearly, rather than on computational efficiency.

We encourage its use in academic settings, for self-study, and for gaining insights into formal language theory. However, for industrial or research applications requiring optimized performance, we recommend seeking out more specialized tools.

## What is the 'Parse Tree Method'?
Basically with this method you can convert an regular expression directly to an DFA, without going through the process of first converting to NFA, then to DFA and finally optimizing the automata (in other words, it's an alternative to the Subset Construction method, of course with pros and cons).

If you need more information about what is this method about, you can go to this page from the well-known and reliable GeeksForGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regular-expression-to-dfa/

## Features

- Supports various regular expression grammar elements including:
  - Concatenation (ab)
  - Alternation (a|b)
  - Kleene star (a*)
  - Plus operator (a+)
  - Optional character (a?)
  - Epsilon (Îµ) - can be typed as "", Îµ, or âˆˆ
- Provides clear examples of valid regular expressions
- Offers options to customize the interpretation of certain operators
- User-friendly interface for entering regular expressions
- Generates DFA based on the input regular expression

## How to Use

1. Enter your regular expression in the provided input field (you can copy and paste one of the examples in the information box)
2. Select any additional options if needed
3. Click the "Generate DFA" button to view the result

## Generated Output

When you click "Generate DFA", the application produces the following items:

1. Parse Tree Graph
2. Follow Pos Table
3. Transitions Table
4. DFA Graph

These outputs provide a comprehensive view of the conversion process from regular expression to DFA, making it an excellent educational and analytical tool.


This tool is perfect for:
- Computer Science students learning about formal languages
- Developers working on text processing or pattern matching
- Anyone interested in exploring the relationship between regular expressions and finite automata

## Issue Note
For now the only thing (that I'm concerned) that this app cannot do, is converting an regular expresion which has only epsilons (like 'Îµ|Îµ?'). While it's obvious that the DFA it's just one state and it's also an ending state and it has no transitions, for now I didn't add that option. Maybe will be fixed in the future, but now it should be fine with anything else.
